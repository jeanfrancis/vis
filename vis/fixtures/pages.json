Individual incidents might not look too serious, but victims can be on the receiving end for months making their life very difficult.\n\nA lot of people and communities suffer from antisocial behaviour and the problem can affect whole streets or neighbourhoods.\n\n\nAlthough every case will be different, some victims of antisocial behaviour have described it as a 'living nightmare'. Sometimes the problem can go on for months, even years, and victims find themselves adapting their lifestyle to try and reduce the problem \u2013 like staying home more, avoiding public transport or even moving home to get away from it. It can be hard for other people to understand just how bad it feels \u2013 they might think that an individual incident doesn't sound too bad, but don't realise that it's just the tip of the iceberg.\n\nYou could be feeling afraid, not sleeping, worry about your safety or your family's safety, or even feeling angry towards the people who are doing this. Lots of different reactions are quite normal and everyone will react in their own way.\n",

        "content": "---\ntitle: I have been attacked\n---\n\nAssault\n\nAssault is a physical attack or a threat that causes fear of an attack. Victims of assault may be attacked by one or more people. An assault may include one or more types of harm, such as pushing, shoving, slapping, punching, or kicking. It may also include the use of weapons like knives, sticks, bottles, or bats. Common injuries from an assault include bruises, black eyes, cuts, scratches, and broken bones. Victims may even be killed during an assault. Even if the attack results in no physical injury to the victim, it still can be considered an assault.\n\nThere are many laws used to classify different kinds of assault. The classification can be based on injury, weapons used, or other circumstances of the crime. Any assault victim, though, injured or not, may experience emotional reactions to the crime.\n\nGun crime\n\nDespite the impression given by the media, crime involving guns is actually quite rare in the UK. However, being involved in a gun crime can cause serious shock and distress, even if a gun isn't actually fired, but only used as a threat, it still remains a very serious crime.\n\nGun crime can include incidents such as:\n\n* Gang attacks, which affect the wider community and can potentially, harm innocent people in the case of mistaken identity.\n* Violent theft where weapons, including guns, are used to threaten and intimidate. (People carrying an imitation or banned handgun is still counted as a gun crime even if it can't be used.)\n* Witness intimidation.\n\nExperiencing gun crime can be a very shocking experience for anyone. Whether or not anyone is actually hurt, the fact that someone has used a gun to force you to do something can cause a strong reaction \u2013 both emotionally and physically.\n\nEveryone will be different in how they respond.\n\nThe experience can leave some people feeling numb. Some feel intense anger towards the perpetrator. Some people turn their anger inward and blame themselves for getting into a situation where such a crime could happen. \u200b\n\nKnife crime\n\nWhile the media tend to focus on knife crime around young people and gangs, it can actually involve people of all ages.\n\nKnives can be used in several criminal situations including robbery, rape, sexual assault and domestic violence. Being a victim of knife crime, or witnessing an attack, can be a shocking experience.\n\nAs well as the obvious and frightening risk of injury, many people have a complex emotional and behavioural response, whether or not they are physically harmed. This is often because they have been forced to do something against their will.\n\nHowever, everyone also reacts to crime differently; you might feel surprisingly calm and unaffected, or you could be overcome by shock and fear, and anything in between. You may feel nothing except intense anger towards the perpetrator. It\u2019s also not uncommon to turn your anger inward and blame yourself for getting into a situation where a crime like this could happen.\n",

It can also extend to \u2018borrowing\u2019 your identity to hide debts or poor credit ratings and, in extreme cases, creating identity documents.\n\nThis crime can be extremely damaging, as not only do you feel powerless to stop the crimes being committed, you may not even be aware that it's happening until it is too late.\n",

These may be your own insurance policies - particularly if you were victim of a property crime such as theft or vandalism. If you know the person who committed the crime you may be able to make a claim against their insurance policies.\n\nYou can ask your employer about damages or insurance entitlements if this is appropriate.\n\nThere may also be [benefits](https://www.gov.uk/browse/benefits/disability) which you can now get if you have serious injuries from which you can't recover quickly.

This is a government fund for victims of crime where you don't know who injured you or they don't have any way to pay. You must apply within two years and you must have cooperated with any police investigation if you want CICA to help.\n\nThis process may take a long time. You do not need to have someone represent you.\n\nIf you disagree with the CICA decision, you can apply to the [First-tier Tribunal (Criminal Injuries Compensation)](https://www.gov.uk/criminal-injuries-compensation-tribunal/overview).",

The code is about you and making sure these organisations help you in the right way. They all know what you're entitled to across the whole justice system, and will make sure that you get to the people who should be helping you right now - no matter who you call.\n\nFor a case that goes all the way to trial you could be contacted up to thirty times, so it's helpful to know who everyone is. Below is a list of the organisations who support the code, and what they do. The most common ones are at the top, and then there is a full list of all the rest.\n\n**Remember:** none of these organisations can give you advice on the evidence you give, they can only advise you on the process\n\n## Most Frequent Organisations\n\n### <a name=\"police\"></a>All police forces in England and Wales\nPolice forces will record and investigate the crime, gathering evidence. This normally includes asking you for a statement of what happened, and they may take photos. When they have enough evidence they will ask the Crown Prosecution Service to take the case to court.\n\nThe police will conduct the first needs assessment to work out what support you need to deal with your crime. They will also be one of the organisations that decide if you'll need any special help in court if you're going to be a witness.\n\n### <a name=\"cps\"></a>Crown Prosecution Service (CPS)\nThe Crown Prosecution Service look at the evidence the police have gathered and will decide whether the case can be taken to court. They will represent your crime on behalf of the government.\n\nYou are unlikely to see anyone from the CPS until the day of a trial, but they will also be making sure you have had the support you need.\n\n### <a name=\"wcu\"></a>Witness Care Units (WCU)\nThe Witness Care Unit will get in touch when the date for a crown court trial has been agreed and help explain the process to you. They will also check that any special arrangements such as video links are in place, and you have made a Victims Personal Statement if you want to.\n\n### <a name=\"hmcts\"></a>Her Majesty's Courts and Tribunals Service (HMCTS)\nThey run the courts for the judges, and will make sure any special arrangements are in place. \n\nThey will tell you the verdict of the court - if someone has been found guilty or not. They will make sure your Victims Personal Statement is read out. You can also ask a member of the HMCTS staff if you find any part of the process stressful or confusing.\n\n### <a name=\"noms\"></a>National Offender Management Service (NOMS)\nResponsible for prisoners, parole and community service. They should be let you know when someone connected with the crime against you is released, and may use your VPS to decide whether the person should be released yet or add any conditions on that release.\n\n### <a name=\"cica\"></a>Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority\nIn many situations you will have other better ways of getting compensation, such as insurance policies. However you can also apply to CICA if you have no other option. This process can take a long time, and you will need to have fully cooperated with the police and CPS to have your case considered.\n\n## Other organisations\nThese bodies have also signed up to the code. If you speak to them you can ask what your entitlements are, and they will also send you to other relevant organisations if they aren't the best ones to help.\n\n* Criminal Cases Review Commission\n* The First-tier Tribunal (Criminal Injuries Compensation)\n* Her Majesty's Prison Service\n* The Parole Board\n* Police and Crime Commissioners\n* British Transport Police and Ministry of Defence Police\n* Providers of probation services, also known as probation trusts\n* UK Supreme Court\n* Youth Offending Teams\n",

However you\u2019re feeling or whenever the crime took place, you can talk to someone from Victim Support in complete confidence.\n\nFraud is when someone steals property, goods or money by tricking, or trying to trick you.\n\nSome common words to describe types of fraud include: \u2018scam\u2019, \u2018con\u2019, \u2018trick\u2019, \u2018sham\u2019, \u2018false representation\u2019 \u2018swindle\u2019, \u2018deceit\u2019, and many more.\n\nOne common tactic used by fraudsters is to use a false identity to commit crimes.\n\nFor example:\n\n* They might use fake name badges and identification.\n* They might deceive you into buying goods or services that are not for sale, or don\u2019t exist.\n* They may provide a service, often of poor quality, but charge you many times the original amount quoted, without reason.\n* They may trick you into giving them money, even large amounts, possibly over a long period of time.\n* They may resort to trying to frighten, bully or harass you to get more money.\n\nIdentity theft\n\nIdentity theft is specifically when someone commits fraud by using your personal details to commit crime.\n\nThis can include deceiving others to open bank accounts, applying for loans, or purchasing goods and services using your bank details and money. It can also extend to \u2018borrowing\u2019 your identity to hide debts or poor credit ratings and, in extreme cases, creating identity documents.\n\nThis crime can be extremely damaging, as not only do you feel powerless to stop the crimes being committed, you may not even be aware that it's happening until it is too late.\n",
